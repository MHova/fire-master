"""Example: bulk-enrich accounts over the REST API.

Account enrichment (fire_role, strategy, notes, targets) is what turns raw Monarch
balances into projection inputs — fire_role drives the net-worth partition and the
RE equity buckets in the wealth projection. Enrichment fields survive Monarch
re-syncs.

This is a TEMPLATE: copy it (e.g. to scripts/enrich_accounts.py, which is yours to
keep out of git), put your real account names in ACCOUNT_ENRICHMENT, and run it
once. You can also enrich account-by-account in the UI — this script just makes a
full first pass faster.

fire_role values the engine understands (see app/engines/fire_projections.py):
  liquid:      cash_reserve | operating_account | speculative
  retirement:  retirement_core | retirement_bridge | retirement_supplemental | tax_free_reserve
  real estate: primary_residence | primary_mortgage | sell_candidate | sell_with_property | income_producing
  other:       illiquid_private | system

Usage:
    API_URL=http://localhost:8000 FIREMASTER_USER=me FIREMASTER_PASSWORD=... \
        uv run python ../scripts/enrich_accounts.example.py
